### Rules of the game

Two players take turn to roll the dice. Points accumulate in the turn's score and player can hold points to transfer them to their global score anytime. If a player chooses to hold points, it becomes other player's turn. If a player rolls a one, the points accumulated in turn's score are lost and it is turn of another player.
